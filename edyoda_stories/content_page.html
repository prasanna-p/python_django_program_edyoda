                            can be controlled by machines and one of the most revolutionary moves
                            has been the advent of artificial intelligence. In this artificial
                            intelligence course, we will talk about how to get started with AI
                            and what exactly it is. While it began as a part of smartphones and
                            other smart devices, AI has been increasingly taking over in other fields too.
                            To begin with, one must understand what Artificial Intelligence is. I
                            t is an area of computer science focusing on the creation of intelligent
